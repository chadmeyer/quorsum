\begin{abstract}
Quorsum is a racing game in which players attempt to move their pawns across
the board by rolling dice.  Additionally, pawns can only move on tiles of
their own colors.  Players can assign their limited dice to flipping tiles
and to moving their pawns toward their homes.  In this note, we discuss some
of the statistical and probablistic considerations surrounding late-game
decision making in a game of quorsum.

\section{Introduction}
Quorsum was introduced by Steve and Will Erickson in circa 2014.  Although
originally called an abstract strategy game, there is some debate whether the
random element of dice roling excludes quorsum from the category.  Nevertheless,
there is no hidden information, and players make their decisions based on the
board layout, current pawn positions and probablilities of rolling certain
numbers on their dice.

Recently, Erickson (2017) presented an analysis of the probabilities of
successfully moving $j$ spaces when starting with $n$ dice, which was analysed
using Markov theory to predict the expected number of turns to reach home.  This
has obvious implications to endgame strategy but is not enough to fully discuss
the possibilities.

This paper will be structured as follows.  In Secion 2, we outline the rules of
quorsum of relevance to our analysis.  In Secion 3, we will outline the results
of Erickson (2017).  In section 4, we discuss single-pawn strategic analysis.

\section{Rules of the game}
A Quorsum board is made up of a 4x4 grid of randomized, reversible (light and
dark) tiles which are numbered from 2 to 6.  Each player has two pawns which
start on a corner and are trying to move to the opposite corner.  Pawns can only
move onto tiles of the same color that they started on.  In order to
interact with a tile (either to flip it, or to move on to a tile) a player must
roll a die with a value greater-than or equal-to the number shown on that tile.

On a player's turn, they have 4 dice which they can allocate to moving their
pawns and/or flipping tiles.  They must declare how each of the dice are 
allocated before rolling and resolving any.  Any number (up to all 4) can be
allocated to any single action, or all 4 could be allocated to different
actions.  Once the dice are allocated, the player can choose to resolve them
in any order, but each action must be fully resolved before moving on.

Dice which are used to flip a tile are only rolled once.  If any one die shows
the number on the tile or higher, the tile is flipped.  Regardless of the
outcome these dice are no longer used until the next turn.  There is an
interesting mechanic which we will invoke later in this paper, whereby a tile
which has just been flipped cannot be immediately re-flipped by the opponent.
In addition to being important for defensive strategy, this will drive
two-turn offensive strategy as well.

When a player wishes to move a pawn, they must first declare which adjacent
tile (of the same color) they would like to move onto.  Note that they do not 
have to declare the entire path ahead of time, just the individual move.  They
then roll all of the dice which are available for moving the pawn.  If none of
the dice show a number greater than or equal to the target tile, the move is
over.  If, however, any of the dice are successful, the pawn moves onto this
tile.  Any dice which showed a lower number than the tile are removed, but
`"successful'' dice (showing a number greater than or equal to the tile) are
retained, and the pawn can move additional spaces using these.  The player may
end their action before they run out of dice if the path ahead is blocked (by
another pawn or a tile which is the wrong color) or if they wish to remain in
a particular location (usually defensively).

\section{Previous Results}
In Erickson (2017), a number of probabilities were derived, which we will
repeat here.  The probability of rolling $d$ dice and at least one die showing
a value greater than tile $t$ is
\begin{equation}
	s\left(d,t\right) = 1-\left(\frac{t-1}{6}\right)^d.
\end{equation}
The probability of exactly $k$ dice surviving when $d$ dice are rolled targeting
tile value $t$ is
\begin{equation}
	s_k\left(d,t\right)=\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
		d \\
		k
	\end{array} \right) \left(s\left(1,t\right)\right)^k
	\left(1-s\left(1,t\right)\right)^{d-k}.
\end{equation}
Now, given a "path" $\mathbf{t}$ (an array of $t$ values), the probability of
going at least $j$ steps along $t_1 \rightarrow t_\ell$ when starting with
$d_1$ dice is
\begin{equation}
	\hat{q}_j\left(d_1,\mathbf{t}\right) \sum_{d_1\geq\cdots\geq d_j\geq 1}
	\left( s\left(d_j,t_j\right)
	\prod_{m=1}^{j-1} s_{d_{m+1}}\left(d_m,t_m\right)\right)
\end{equation}
with the probability of ending exactly on tile j being
\begin{equation}
	q_j\left(d_1,\mathbf{t}\right)= \hat{q}_j\left(d_1,\mathbf{t}\right) -
	\hat{q}_{j+1}\left(d_1,\mathbf{t}\right).
\end{equation}
The sum above is over all valid sets of $j$ die rolls for which the first roll
is $d_1$ an the last is at least 1.  Finally, we define the probability of
starting on space $i$ and ending on $j$ as $q_{ij}(\mathbf{t})$, which can be
defined by setting the first $i$ values of $\mathbf{t}$ to 1 or by taking the
appropriate sub-portion of $\mathbf{t}$ for $j-i$ steps.

With these ingredients in hand we can define the transition matrix $Q$ for
$\mathbf{t}$ where entries are $Q_{ij}=q_{ij}$.  Markov theory then predicts
the expected number of turns and the probability of success in $N$ turns (see
Erickson (2017) section 4.4).  

\section{Single pawn strategy}
In this section we will generalize the results of Erickson (2017) to include
the potential need to flip a tile.  No concern of balancing actions between two
pawns/paths will be discussed yet.

Our first building block will be a composite move of flipping a tile and
moving on to it.  We will need to consider probabilities over multiple turns
for completeness.  This is where the ``guarded'' state of a newly-flipped tile
comes in.  But first, we consider single-turn probabilities.  What is the
probability of both successfully turning over a tile $t$ using $d_t$ dice and
then successfully moving on to it using $d_m$ dice?  The probability of
flipping is simply $s(d_t,t)$ and the probability of moving is $s(d_m,t)$,
therefore the probability of advancing in this way is $s(d_m,t)s(d_t,t)$.
Assuming we had 4 dice at our disposal, the single turn maximum would be
$d_m=d_n=2$.  The two-turn probabilities are more interesting.  If one had
